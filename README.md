### So, what is it?
GiphyGetter is a handy Giphy integration for your Slack. It lets you quickly search for and post an animated gif to your channels.
You can also pick a new gif, reserve one you like, banish one to the abyss, or just delete it when you're done laughing.

### What does it look like?
You type this: | You get this:
--- | ---
`/giphy picard facepalm` | ![](https://giphygetter.legendserver.info/images/giphyGetterExample_0001.png)

### What do the buttons do?
**Different GIF**: Searches for a different gif and replaces the you you currently have.  
**Delete**: Removes the bot post from your channel.  
**Reserve**: Reserves your search term with the current gif. Search for the same thing, get the same gif.  
**Banish**: Prevent the current gif from showing up again in any GiphyGetter search, ever.
